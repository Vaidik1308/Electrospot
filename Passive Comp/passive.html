                <h2>Passive Components</h2>
                <p>A passive element is an electrical component that does not generate power, but instead dissipates, stores, and/or releases it. Passive elements include resistances, capacitors, and coils (also called inductors). These components are labeled in circuit diagrams as Rs, Cs and Ls, respectively. In most circuits, they are connected to active elements, typically semiconductor devices such as amplifiers and digital logic chips.

                <h3>Resistor</h3>
                <p>A resistor is a primary type of physical component that is used in electronic circuits. It has two (interchangeable) leads. The material placed internally between the two leads of a resistor opposes (restricts) the flow of current. The amount of that opposition is called its resistance, which is measured in ohms (Ω). Resistors are used to control the various currents in areas of a circuit and to manage voltage levels at different points therein by producing voltage drops. When a voltage is applied across a resistor, current flows through it. Ohm's law for resistors is E = IR, where E is the voltage across the resistor, R is the resistance of the resistor, and I is the current flowing through the resistor. That current is proportional to the applied voltage, and inversely proportional to the resistance. Thus, as resistance goes up, the current through the element comes down, so that at high resistances the current is very small.</p>
                <p>Ohm's law makes it possible to calculate any one of three circuit values (current, voltage, or resistance) from the other two.</p>

                <h3>Capacitor</h3>
                <p>A capacitor is another primary type of physical component used in electronic circuits. It has two leads and is used to store and release electric charge. A capacitor's ability to store charge is referred to as its capacitance, measured in farads (F).</p>
                <p> A typical capacitor takes the form of two conductive plates separated by an insulator (dielectric). This type of circuit element cannot pass direct current (DC) because electrons cannot flow through the dielectric. However, a capacitor does pass alternating current (AC) because an alternating voltage causes the capacitor to repeatedly charge and discharge, storing and releasing energy. Indeed, one of the major uses of capacitors is to pass alternating current while blocking direct current, a function called 'AC coupling'.When a direct current flows int</p>

            <div class="lm inductor">
                <h3>Inductor</h3>
                <p>An inductor is another passive device that can store or deliver energy but cannot generate it. An ideal inductor is lossless, meaning that it can store energy indefinitely as no energy is lost as heat. Inductors present a low impedance path to DC current and a high impedance path to AC current.</p>

                <p>The impedance of an inductor called inductive reactance varies with frequency and in an ideal inductor the current of the AC sine wave lags the voltage by 90o.</p>
                
                <p>Then we can define inductance, L as the measure of an inductor’s “resistance” to the change of current with the larger the value of L, the lower the rate of change of current. Like resistance, inductance is always a positive value.</p>

            <div class="lm coil">
                <h3>Coil</h3>
                <p>A coil, also called an inductor, is yet another primary type of physical component that is used in electronic circuits. It has two leads and is typically implemented as one or more windings (loops) of conductive wire. That wire is often but not necessarily formed around a core of iron or steel or some other magnetic material. Current through the coil induces a magnetic field that serves as a store of energy. Inductance is measured in henries (H).</p>

                <p>More specifically, a current flowing through a wire generates a magnetic field, the direction of which is to the right relative to the flow of the current, as described by the 'right-hand rule' (see Figure 4). If the wire is coiled, the fluxes are in alignment. According to Lenz's law, changes in the coil's magnetic field generate a counter-electromotive force (and an induced current) that opposes those changes. Thus, coils can be used in electronic circuits to restrict the flow of alternating current while allowing direct current to pass.</p>
