                        Before the discovery of ICs, the basic method of making circuits was to select the components like diodes, transistors, resistors, inductors and capacitors and connect them by shouldering. But due to size and power consumption issues, it was necessary to develop a small size circuit with less power consumption, reliability and shockproof.</p>

                    <p>
                        After the invention of the semiconductors and transistors, things were quite simplified to a particular extent, but the development of integrated circuits changed electronics technology’s face. Jack Kilby from Texas Instruments and Bob Noyce from Intel are the official creators of integrated circuits, and they did it independently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The integrated circuit is a fundamental concept of electronics that builds on other basic concepts previously discussed in our syllabus. Therefore, for a quick reference, go through the articles listed below:
                    </p>

                        # Resistors <br>
                        # Transistors <br>
                        # Diodes <br>
                        # Capacitors 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Definition of Integrated Chip</h4>
                    <p>
                        Integrated circuits are made up of several components such as R, C, L, diodes and transistors. They are built on a small single block or chip of a semiconductor known as an integrated circuit (IC). All of them work together to perform a particular task. The IC is easily breakable, so to be attached to a circuit board, it is often housed in a plastic package with metal pins.
                        Integrated Chip <br>
                        Integrated circuits can function as an oscillator, amplifiers, microprocessors or even as computer memory.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Integrated Circuit Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        An integrated circuit is created using certain logic methods and circuit layouts. The two categories of IC design are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        # Analog Design <br>
                        # Digital Design <br>
                        # Mixed Design
                    </p>
                    <h4>Integrated Circuit Features</h4>
                    <p>
                        1.ICs are built with semiconducting components such as silicon. Because of the small size and delicate nature of IC, a series of tiny gold and aluminium wires are joined together and moulded into a flat block of plastic or ceramic. Metal pins on the block’s exterior link to cables inside. The solid block stops the chip from overheating and keeps it cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.The size of the integrated chip varies between 1 square mm to more than 200 mm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.Because they combine various devices on one chip, integrated chips get their name. A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines a microprocessor, memory, and interface into a single unit.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Commonly Used ICs</h4>
                    <p>
                        # Logic Gate Ics <br>
                        # Timer ICs <br>
                        # Operational Amplifiers <br>
                        # Voltage Regulators
