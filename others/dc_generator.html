                    <h3>What is a DC Generator?</h3>

                    <p>
                        A DC generator is an electrical machine whose main function is to convert mechanical energy into electricity. When the conductor slashes magnetic flux, an emf will be generated based on the electromagnetic induction principle of Faraday’s Laws. This electromotive force can cause a flow of current when the conductor circuit is closed  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Parts of a DC Generator</h4>
                    <p>
                        A DC generator can also be used as a DC motor without changing its construction. Therefore, a DC motor, otherwise a DC generator, can be generally called a DC machine. Below we have mentioned the essential parts of a DC Generator.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Stator:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        The main function of the stator is to provide magnetic fields where the coil spins. A stator includes two magnets with opposite polarities facing each other. These magnets are located to fit in the region of the rotor.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Rotor:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        A rotor in a DC machine includes slotted iron lamination with slots that are stacked to shape a cylindrical armature core. The function of the lamination is to decrease the loss caused due to eddy current.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Armature Windings:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        Armature windings are in a closed circuit form and are connected in series to parallel to enhance the produced current sum.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Yoke:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        The external structure of the DC generator is known as Yoke. It is made of either cast iron or steel. It provides the necessary mechanical power for carrying the magnetic flux given through the poles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Poles:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        The function of a pole is to hold the field windings. These windings are wound on poles and are either connected in series or parallel by the armature windings.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Commutator:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        SA commutator works like a rectifier that changes AC voltage to DC voltage within the armature winding. It is designed with a copper segment, and each copper segment is protected from the other with the help of mica sheets. It is located on the shaft of the machine.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Brushes:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        The electrical connections can be ensured between the commutator as well as the exterior load circuit with the help of brushes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How does a DC Generator Work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        According to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, we know that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a varying magnetic field, an emf is induced in the conductor. According to Fleming’s right-hand rule, the direction of the induced current changes whenever the direction of motion of the conductor changes. Let us consider an armature rotating clockwise and a conductor at the left moving upwards. When the armature completes a half rotation, the direction of the motion of the conductor will be reversed downward. Hence, the direction of the current in every armature will be alternating. But with a split ring commutator, connections of the armature conductors get reversed when a current reversal occurs. Therefore, we get a unidirectional current at the terminals.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Applications of DC Generators:-</h4>
                    <p>
                        A few applications of DC generators are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	The separately excited type DC generators are used for power and lighting purposes. <br>
                        •	The series DC generator is used in arc lamps for lighting, stable current generator and booster. <br>
                        •	DC generators are used to reimburse the voltage drop within Feeders. <br>
                        •	DC generators are used to provide a power supply for hostels, lodges, offices, etc
